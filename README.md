🏎️ CRUDS CAR: Advanced Vehicle Inventory System

A comprehensive Inventory Management System designed for car dealerships or collectors. This application demonstrates advanced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with real-time calculations and local data persistence.

🚀 Key Features

Full CRUD Functionality: Add new vehicles, view the inventory, update details, or delete entries seamlessly.

Real-time Cost Calculation: Automatically calculates the total price by adding taxes and fees and subtracting discounts as you type.

Data Persistence: Uses localStorage to ensure your inventory data is saved even after closing the browser.

Dynamic Search: Instantly filter through the inventory by Brand, Model, or Fuel Type.

Bulk Operations: Create multiple entries at once using the "Count" field, or clear the entire database with one click.

Responsive Card UI: Modern, elegant card layout that adapts to different screen sizes, featuring "Tape" styling for a unique look.

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Logic: Complex JavaScript functions for managing the state of the application (Create vs. Update modes).

Validation: Ensures mandatory fields (Brand, Model, Price) are filled before submission.

UI/UX: Smooth scrolling to the top during updates and visual feedback (color badges) for price status.
